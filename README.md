**edawson25/edawson25** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently on my fifth and final quarter at Drexel.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with coding if I need to do more.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about books cause I read a lot.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Send me snail mail.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her/hers
- âš¡ Fun fact: I met Corbin Bleu once and he said happy birthday to me.
